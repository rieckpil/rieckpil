Hi there 👋

With my [blogging](https://rieckpil.de) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/rieckpil) efforts, I try to **make testing Spring Boot applications more joyful** (or at least less painful). 

By providing clear and concise guides with thorough explanations and best practices, I help developers incorporate testing into their daily routine rather than making it an afterthought 🧪

Say hi on [X 🐥](https://x.com/rieckpil) or [LinkedIn 👔](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rieckpil/).

Joyful testing,<br/>
Philip

## Testing Spring Boot Applications Made Simple 🍃


**Stop guessing if your Spring Boot app will work in production** ❌

Poor tests mean late nights, stressed teammates, and disappointed stakeholders. Teams desperately need developers who can ship confidently.

**Become the developer your team relies on** ✅

Your teammates will trust your code, your deployments will succeed consistently, and you'll finally escape the cycle of emergency fixes that drain everyone's energy.
